      available, and continued with a small team to iterate and enhance the platform.

      \item Established engineering culture and practice, including coding standards, CI/workflow/automation
      enhancements, API design styles, abstraction patterns, etc.

      \item Managed all technical company IT management and procurement.

      \item Developed technical hiring program for engineers and researchers.

      \item Above work enabled team to contributed to multiple external workshops
      \autocite{neurips_llm_efficiency_2023, kdd_2023_workshop} and develop a more cohesive roadmap.

  {\twittericon}{Senior Machine Learning Research Engineer}{Twitter}{June 2020}{January 2023}{Remote \textemdash USA}{
    Tech Lead for the Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability
    (META) team tasked with Responsible Machine Learning development and
    research at Twitter.\\*
    \begin{myitemize}
      \item As a technical lead, provided process improvement, technical guidance, mentorship, review, roadmap
      planning, and organization-wide improvements.

      \item Designed and built a data collection system, tools, and workflows that reduced time in critical
      phases of common research projects from weeks of manual work to days with more reliable results.
      This led to company-wide adoption of a model quality/bias metric that we developed.

      \item Led workstream to design and build tools for machine learning practitioners to identify biases and
      weaknesses in model performance that were in use by multiple teams.

      \item Outside of the above, contributed to team
      research\autocite{twitter_htl_racial_bias,twitter_recsys_distributional_inequality} and outreach,
      presenting at conferences (ACM FAccT \autocite{facct_2022_talk}, The Data Science Conference
      \autocite{datascience_2022_talk}) and more \autocite{privacy_enchancing_tech_post}.

      \item Continued leadership in company groups as stated below.

  {\twittericon}{Senior Data Scientist}{Twitter}{July 2017}{June 2020}{Boulder, CO}{
    Worked with various teams, most importantly as tech lead for the Health Data Science team,
    which worked on combating abuse, spam, fake accounts, and misinformation problems.\\*
    \begin{myitemize}
      \item Developed tooling, education, and processes that enabled data scientists to work more effectively
      with heterogenous data sources. Tools were used by hundreds of data scientists, ML, and data
      engineers weekly, and leadership supported me leading a small team to do this work more formally.

      \item Developed strategy, model, and pipeline for identifing potentially compromised accounts.

      \item Developed open-source libraries and tools for external
      users.\autocite{search_tweets_python,do_more_with_twitter_data}

      \item Identified risk factors in developer applications to enable programmatic review of customer
      applications to use Twitter APIs.

      \item Identified clusters of apps abusing Twitter's APIs using time-series mining, allowing programmatic
      action to be taken against offenders.

      \item Served on company advisory groups for data architecture, open-source development, and Python
      development.

      \item Served as a Global Lead for Twitter's Alas BRG for Hispanic and Latinx employees.

\begin{job}
  {\tripicon}{Data Scientist}{Tripadvisor}{July 2016}{July 2017}{Greater Boston Area}{
    Data Scientist for the Vacation Rentals group building scalable models to tackle business problems.\\*
    \begin{myitemize}
      \item Designed and built a computer vision system that includes models to detect people, content (e.g.,
      beach, bedroom, kitchen), and rate aesthetic quality, with basic measures to prevent unwanted bias.

      \item Above system was adopted by other groups at TripAdvisor and powered multiple systems. In Vacation
      Rentals, it lead to a \textbf{4.8\% increases} in a primary click-through rate metric and a
      \textbf{10.4\% increase} in revenue from ad expenditures.

      \item Built an NLP app that enables natural-language queries (e.g.\ ``girls getaway'') to find
      collections of destinations, which led to a \textbf{6.1\% improvement} in a primary metric and was
      used by many teams.

      \item Developed language-modeling tools to extract high-information snippets from reviews to display on
      search-result pages to boost SEO rankings.

      \item Developed a common team codebase providing shared tools, common access methods, and other utility
      code that allowed our data scientists and engineers to get up-to-speed more quickly and iterate
      faster on projects.

                  patterns.

            \item A/B testing showed that the model \textbf{increased a key visitor conversion rate by 3.46\%},
                  \textbf{decreased visitor bounce rate by 0.46\%}, and \textbf{increase revenue per visitor by
                    9.57\%}.
