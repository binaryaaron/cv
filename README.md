# My CV

A curriculum vitae/resume that I make wholehearted attempts to update frequently. It's
based off of the Friggeri template and modified somewhat heavily to fit my
fancy. It's in the src folder.

I've also added a cover letter version that matches the header and format of the
resume; please feel free to use this.
